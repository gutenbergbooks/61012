<h3>BUREAU OF WOMAN’S WORK.</h3>

<h4>APPOINTMENT OF SECRETARY.</h4>

<p>It gives us pleasure to announce that in following out the
arrangements fore-shadowed in the May “Missionary,” the Executive
Committee of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. has made choice of Miss D.&nbsp;E. Emerson as
Secretary of its Bureau of Woman’s Work. Miss Emerson is well known
in the mission fields of the Association, having been a teacher, a
lady missionary and also at the New York Office doing service in
connection with the correspondence for the Southern work. In the
latter position, covering a period of several years, she has had
occasion to visit localities occupied by our lady missionaries, and
in these and many other ways has gained a very extensive knowledge
of the wants and the methods of help needful for the elevation of
the colored people. Her ability for her new position has already
been tested, and the Association has great confidence in her
capacity to meet the requirements of all interested in the great
work that lies before her. Correspondence relating to the Bureau
should be addressed to Miss D.&nbsp;E. Emerson, at the office of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., 56 Reade St., New York.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>METHODS OF WORK.</h4>

<p>Our Bureau inaugurates no new woman’s missionary society. It is
simply a plan for giving more efficiency to the work already in
hand. We leave the mode of co-operation on the part of the ladies
of the North entirely to themselves, and we can think of no better
plan for such co-operation than that given on the next page in the
letter of Miss M.&nbsp;E. Smith of Gorham, Me., which describes the
methods in use the past year in that State.</p>

<p>Neither are the means for promoting the objects of our Bureau new;
they are based on twenty years’ experience and extend to all the
branches of home, school and church life. We can aid directly in
the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a> elevation of women and children through the varied work of
the ladies engaged in our different mission fields. Our method of
giving information to the Christian women of the North will be not
only by correspondence through the Secretary of the Bureau, but
also by direct information from the lady missionaries and teachers,
who will attend the meetings of ladies at the conferences,
associations, and, as far as practicable, local societies in
connection with the churches.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>METHOD OF CO-OPERATION.</h4>

<p class="secauth">FROM MISS MARY E. SMITH, MAINE.</p>

<p>In answer to your inquiry as to the mode of collecting, I would say
that we have <em>no</em> organization. The ladies talked the matter over
and decided that as there are so many organizations already as to
be almost bewildering, we would carry on this work with as little
“red tape” as possible. At each annual conference a meeting of all
ladies interested is held, a report read of the amount collected
the past year and a committee of three chosen to carry on the work
for the following year. This committee appoints a collector for
each conference, and each conference collector engages a collector
in each church in her conference. The collectors of the several
churches report progress and send money obtained to the conference
collector, and she forwards it to the chairman of the State
Committee, who keeps the bank account and forwards the money in due
time to the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</p>

<p>By so simple an arrangement we also save in expense. With the
exception of a very slight amount for printing of circulars for
distribution through the States, the only expense is that of
postage, etc., which being divided among so many is borne by the
several collectors and does not take from the sum collected. So
far the working of our plan has been, I think, as successful as we
could reasonably expect.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>LETTERS OF SYMPATHY.</h4>

<p class="secauth">FROM MRS. HENRY L. CHASE, IOWA.</p>

<p>It is with great satisfaction that I learn that a “Bureau of
Woman’s Work” has been organized in connection with the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. It
seems to me that such an organization is not merely a valuable help
but a manifest necessity in the effective prosecution of “Woman’s
Work for Woman” in the South—a work which lies upon the hearts of
very many of the Christian women of the North and which ought to
lie upon the consciences of all.</p>

<p>A very limited experience teaches that in every kind of benevolent
work <em>information</em> is the root from which interest and action
grow. Probably in no other way can the facts which will quicken
the interest of the ladies of our churches in work among the
Freedpeople be so thoroughly and influentially presented as by
means of this Bureau. Specific objects of effort, concerning
which details may be furnished, will often win the practical
attention of those who are comparatively indifferent<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a> to the idea
of general needs. And the sanction of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. being implied
in any appeals made thorough the Bureau for definite objects, will
give assurance that our gifts and our labors are to be applied
in the wisest way and where the need is most urgent. But perhaps
nothing accomplished by this organization will be more gratefully
appreciated or more productive of the desired results than the
visits of missionaries to the churches which support them, and
their statements by word of mouth in regard to the appalling needs
and encouraging successes in their various fields. This new branch
of work has my warmest good wishes and my earnest prayers for its
fullest success.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h5>BRIEF RESPONSES.</h5>

<p>Miss A.&nbsp;W. Johnson of North Brookfield, Mass., writes: I am very
glad that a “Bureau of Woman’s Work” has been organized, and
believe it will open up new avenues for work among our ladies. I
respond at once, hoping I can do something to interest them in this
direction.</p>

<p>Rev. S.&nbsp;E. Lathrop of Macon, Ga., writes: I rejoice in the new
“Bureau of Woman’s Work.” It is a necessary and hopeful acquisition.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>BUREAU REPRESENTED IN OHIO.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the Ohio State Association which convened at Akron, May
8, Dist. Sec. Pike in his address set forth the plans of our Bureau
of Woman’s Work, referring especially to the methods proposed for
bringing the condition of the colored people more fully before the
Christian women of the North. He was accompanied by Miss Rose M.
Kinney, who had just returned from her field of labor at McIntosh,
Liberty County, Ga., and who, in behalf of our Bureau of Woman’s
Work, gave an interesting account of her mission services, which
had included that of organizing a Woman’s Missionary Society among
the colored women. Miss Kinney also addressed the Woman’s meeting
held during the sessions of the Association. Arrangements have
been made, as far as practicable, with other States for a like
presentation of the varied work carried on by this Association.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the next and future numbers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, the
details of the “Bureau of Woman’s Work” will appear in a separate
department under the above heading.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Lord’s Blessed Ones.</span>—A recent visitor to the
Teachers’ Home, Storrs School, Atlanta, writes that on his arrival,
about nine in the evening, he was met by the lady teachers, who
were returning, two by two, from attending cottage prayer meetings
in the parish, of which there had been six that night. “Coming in,”
he says, “from such work in the lowly homes of a despised people,
cheerful and delighted with the meetings, they made a profound
impression upon me as the Lord’s blessed ones. If He hasn’t got any
mansions up there quite worthy of them He’ll go to work and fix up
some especially for their use.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> readers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> are not ignorant
of the benefactions of Mr. J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H. Gregory, of Marblehead, Mass.,
to this Association. The following extract from a Wilmington paper
indicates the appreciation in which he is held not only by the
colored people, but also by leading citizens South.</p>

<p>“The reception of Mr. Gregory took place in the Mayor’s office in
the City Hall yesterday at noon. There was quite a large attendance
of our prominent citizens, including a few colored men, all of
whom gave evidence of the esteem entertained for the distinguished
visitor and their pleasure at the opportunity thus afforded them
of forming the acquaintance of one who has devoted so much of
his fortune to the advancement of the educational facilities and
interests of Wilmington. Mr. Gregory was introduced to those
present by Mayor Hall in a few brief and appropriate remarks, which
were responded to by Mr. G. in fitting terms. Short speeches were
also delivered by Rev. Drs. Taylor and Wilson, in the order named,
and at the conclusion of their remarks, Mayor Hall again spoke,
and at more length. The meeting was a very pleasant one, and we
have reason to believe that Mr. Gregory was much pleased at the
heartiness of his reception.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trustees of the John F. Slater Educational Fund met
in New York April 25 and 26. It was voted to appropriate $20,000
during the coming year to such schools as are best fitted to help
young colored people to become useful to their race, preference
being given to those institutions which furnish industrial
education. Over seventy institutions have already reported to
Rev. Dr. A.&nbsp;G. Haygood, the Secretary. It is not conclusive from
the reports that have reached us that the sum named above is the
entire amount that will be applied the coming year for educational
purposes, or that the income of the fund will be principally used
for industrial education. We believe the plans of the Trustees are
as broad as the necessities of the colored people for education in
every department. The meeting of the Board was fully attended, and
the place made vacant by the death of Wm. E. Dodge was filled by
the election of his son. We commend the Trustees for their careful
and conscientious endeavors to provide for the uplifting of the
colored people and the welfare of the nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> average attendance at the 30 conventions of the
Co-operative Societies in Connecticut was 136. The number of
churches represented was 230, of the 297 in the State. The average
attendance of similar meetings in 1872 was 104. On the whole the
recent meetings were of marked interest, and of much encouragement
to the missionary work done by Congregationalists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our Finances.</span>—During the seven months of the fiscal year
closing April 30, our receipts from collections and donations have
amounted to $109,275.73. The collections and donations for the
same months last year were $138,094.35, a decrease of $28,818.62.
The legacies for these months last year were $23,447.81, while for
this year they have been $42,121.18, an increase of $18,673.37. The
total receipts thus far this year in collections, donations and
legacies have been $151,396.91 against $161,542.16 for the same
period last year, a decrease of $10,145.25. We earnestly urge the
friends of this Association to study these figures. Our last annual
meeting, in view of the pressing work before us, recommended the
increase of our receipts 25 per cent. for the present fiscal year.
The added expenses of our Indian work and the pressing calls for
enlargement of our school and church work South, make this increase
imperative—and especially as the openings before us in these
lines of effort are exceedingly auspicious and encouraging. If the
increase named is received, we can go forward; if not, we must
leave undone what ought to be done. Under these circumstances, we
ask individual donors whom God hath blessed with the means and the
heart to help, to give special attention to the facts we present,
and we also respectfully request pastors to bring before their
people our financial necessities, so that during the next five
months we may be able to go forward without debt or diminution of
work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Church Book</span>, Hymns and Tunes, for the Uses of
Christian Worship, prepared by Leonard Woolsey Bacon. New York:
D. Appleton &amp; Co. Several novelties are presented by this book.
The more prominent of these are (1) the typographical arrangement,
which allows the hymns to go in without the usual limitations
of space, (2) the number of hymns, which is less than half that
usually found in books of the kind, (3) a combination of the
standard tunes with the best of the English lyrical compositions.
We believe there is common sense in Dr. Bacon’s idea that the
church will be better served with a smaller number of the choicest
hymns. As both the standard and (so called) classical tunes are
selected with excellent judgment, we see no reason why the Church
Book may not prove a valuable addition to the hymn-and-tune-ology
of the day. The typography and binding of the book are of the best.</p>

The volume is tastefully<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a> prepared and printed in red and black,

<h3>A VALUABLE BOOK ON INDIAN MISSIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian Missions</span> is a volume of 270 pages, published by
the Am. S.&nbsp;S. Union, from the pen of Rev. Myron Eells, missionary
of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. among the Indians in Washington Territory. Mr.
Eells is the son of a missionary, who gave himself to the work
on the Pacific Coast in 1838. He grew up in that country, and is
perhaps as well qualified as any man living to write the history
and results of the work of different benevolent societies among
the Indian tribes of that section. In the book before us he gives
in order the history of the early missions of the Methodist
Episcopal Church and those of the American Board, making mention
of the development of the work in ten localities among as many
different tribes. The progress of civilizing agencies is recorded
with a fidelity and minuteness that adds much to the value of the
volume. It appears that most of the missionaries believed that the
Bible and the plow should go hand in hand, and that through their
influence the Indians were stimulated to cultivate lands, build
houses, abandon polygamy, become temperate, connect themselves
with churches, and place their children in schools. The author
expresses the fear that his statistics relating to such matters
may be considered too large, but affirms that they have been taken
from official reports. He comforts himself, also, in the words of
another, to the effect that “if one-fourth of all that is reported
has been accomplished, a great work has been done.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></p>

<p>Part II. of Mr. Eells’ book treats of the reflex influence of the
mission upon the whites. His claims are no less interesting than
surprising. He says: “Indian missions brought the first white
woman overland to Oregon, opened the first emigrant wagon road to
the Columbia River, furnished Oregon with the first United States
officer, gave the first governor to the Territory, established the
first permanent American settlement here, so that without this aid
the Provisional Government would, without doubt, never have been
organized, brought the first American cattle to the Willamette
Valley, and saved the country, or, at least, an important portion
of it, to the United States.”</p>

<p>Indeed, when he tells the story of Dr. Whitman’s winter journey
to Washington, pursuant to the vote of the missionaries, “to make
a desperate effort to save the country to the United States,”
he is not only graphic but eloquent. His description of the
hardships of the winter’s campaign and of the grand success of the
return journey with scores of emigrants, who illustrated beyond
question that women and wagons could cross the mountains, and that
missionaries at least had the enterprise needful to provide the
agency for establishing a provisional government at the focal point
in the history of our western territories, is full of interest.</p>

<p>It is impossible, however, in our limited space, even to allude to
all the topics touched upon. We must ask our readers to purchase
the volume. It is well suited for Sabbath-school libraries, and
will be welcomed by good men everywhere who love mission work. As
a testimony in behalf of the far-reaching influences of missionary
endeavors, it is of rare excellence. We hope its circulation will
be swift and extensive.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>AFRICA.</h4>

<p>—The caravan of English missionaries conducted by Mr. Stokes has
reached the extreme south of Victoria Nyanza, a little to the west
of Kaghei.</p>

<p>—Mr. Resteau has established at Ambrisette the first factory of
the Belgian Company for African commerce. He has sent the plans for
another establishment that the company will found in the region
south of the Congo.</p>

<p>—The Committee of English missions has accepted for its stations
on the Niger the services of Dr. Percy Brown, who offers himself
for work in any part of the mission field.</p>

<p>—The new king of Cayor has made a visit to the Governor of St.
Louis, promising to aid with all his power the construction of the
railroad. In two or three weeks the section from Dakar to Rufisque
will be finished.</p>

<p>—The British and African Steam Navigation Company, which has
already 20 ships for service on the west side of Africa, has
constructed<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a> two others of less draught that they may leap the sand
banks of the lower rivers. They will be named the Lagos and the
Calabar.</p>

<p>—Unwilling to yield to any one the territory of Liberia, the
Senate of Monrovia is prepared to place the question of the
southern limits of this State, a subject on which it disagrees with
England, to the arbitration of the United States.</p>

<p>—Mr. Piazzi Smythe has communicated to the English journal
<cite>Nature</cite>, from a correspondent at Santa Cruz, capital of Teneriffe,
that the peak of Teyde, which has not had an eruption since 1798,
has broken out again since the commencement of 1883. A river of
lava descends from its summit, still covered with snow.</p>

<p>—The Baptist missionaries settled at Manyanga and Stanley Pool,
where their stations have taken the names of Wathen and Arthington,
in honor of the two principal supporters of their work, have felt
more and more obliged to free themselves from the protection of the
armed Zanzibarites of the Belgian expeditions. Since the attack in
which M. Peschuel Locsche was wounded they have felt that the route
along the northern side of the river from Manyanga to Stanley Pool
was safe only for strong caravans well armed, and they have sought
one upon the southern side. There the Belgians, after having burned
Ngombi, whose chief was disposed to attack the caravans, have
made a new route to Stanley Pool, and Lieut. Valcke has founded a
station at Ngombi and organized a service of caravans between that
point and Stanley Pool. The missionaries have one independent of
the Belgians, so that caravans pass every four or five days. The
security of transport is greater, but the price of everything is
greatly increased.</p>

<p>—The combats between the people of Stanley and the natives have
arrested the advance of the missionaries of the Livingstone Inland
mission. After having gone 50 kilometres beyond their station,
they were obliged to found a new station upon the Loukounga in
the midst of a population always well disposed toward them. Also
the missionaries of this mission have decided not to establish
themselves at Stanley Pool, and have actually gone to work in
the region near their stations, 50 or 60 kilometres apart, over
an extent of 170 kilometres. During the five years in which they
have lived there they have never had a quarrel with the natives,
who respect them and confide their children to them. They have
learned the language of the country, prepared many pupils to become
teachers, and found the natives eager to furnish them the products
of the country and at their service for porters along the route
from one station to the other.</p>

<h4>THE INDIANS.</h4>

<p>—The last session of Congress appropriated $300,000 to the
Cherokees as payment for the lands now occupied by the Nez Perces,
Poncas, Pawnees and Otoes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></p>

<p>—The Indian Homestead Colony at Flandreau, D.T., reports that
ninety-four homesteads have been taken by the Indians to be held at
least five years by them.</p>

<p>—Four hundred thousand dollars have been appropriated by the
general government for the support of Indian day and industrial
schools and for other educational purposes.</p>

<p>—Capt. R.&nbsp;H. Pratt is to receive $68,500 for the support of the
Indian Industrial School at Carlisle, Pa. This amount is to cover
all expenditures for transportation of Indians, and for the salary
and support of teachers and students.</p>

<p>—A new Industrial School for Indian girls has been started by the
Government at West Branch, Iowa. Mr. Benjamin Miles is to have
charge of the enterprise. The school has capacity for fifty pupils,
and by the terms of the appropriation, none can be received who are
under fourteen years of age.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>—According to Missionary Butler, of China, as Buddhism has no
heaven for women, the Chinese damsels labor with might and main to
lay up merits that they may prevail with the judges of the lower
world to let them be born again as men, so that they may have a
chance to get there.</p>

<p>—More than 280 Christian women are banded together in England,
daily praying for blessing to rest upon the work among the poor,
degraded and down-trodden women of China. Three of the members of
this Woman’s Prayer Union for the Women of China have been accepted
by the China Inland Mission, and are hoping soon to leave for their
future sphere of work.</p>

<p>—A happy thought for a Christian wedding party found expression
at Norwich, England, on the occasion of the marriage of Rev. J.&nbsp;O.
Hoare, son of Canon Hoare and Principal of the C.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S. College,
at Ningpo. After breakfast it was proposed to make a special
collection for the China mission, which resulted in subscriptions
amounting to about $2,200.</p>

<p>—The edict against Christianity in Japan has never been repealed.
At first, only teaching was permitted, and that was to be secular;
then preaching in private was tolerated; then followed assembles
for Christian worship, and the organization of Christian churches;
and in October, 1880, the natives held a meeting in the open air on
the grounds of a hotel in the public park at Uyeno; some four or
five thousand people were present, and the meeting lasted two days.
It was openly advertised in the native newspapers and publicly
announced by large post-bills which met the eye in all parts of the
city, and one of which was on the very spot where the old edict
board used to stand. And yet the government does not interfere.</p>

<h3>A REMARKABLE TRIBUTE.</h3>

<h4>HOW IT PAYS TO EDUCATE COLORED MINISTERS.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. W.&nbsp;W. PATTON, D.D., WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Facts are worth more than abstract theories. Let the people
have the facts. Howard University has for a number of years
been carrying on a theological department, which has educated
many colored ministers for all the evangelical denominations in
this country, besides sending several missionaries to Africa.
This department is mainly supported by the American Missionary
Association, and its principal professorship has been partially
endowed by Mrs. Stone. From this institution went forth a few years
since, a young man (Rev. A.&nbsp;J. Henry) of unmixed African blood,
who took as his field of labor a benighted county in Virginia. As
the result of his patient, self-denying toil, several churches and
schools have been established, and a new character has been given
to the whole community. In proof of this, I am permitted to quote
the following letter, voluntarily sent by the Prosecuting Attorney
of the county to Mr. Henry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Amelia Court House</span>, Va., Jan. 31, 1883.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: There has been such a marked improvement
in the conduct, character, morals and intelligence of the
colored population of this county, and crime has diminished
to such an extent with the past several years, that it is
natural that an observing man should at once consider the
cause or reason for such a changed state of affairs. In doing
so, I am at once constrained to believe and to attribute it
to your untiring zeal in the laudable effort to do good to
that race whose training has been so long neglected. Your
boldness in condemning the wrong and asserting and approving
the right, has not only impressed the colored people and
influenced their conduct in the right direction, but it has at
the same time won for you the confidence and esteem of all the
thinking portion of the white race who are interested in good
government, and a well-ordered and law-abiding community. It
is not surprising to thinking men that an immense amount of
crime should have been the result of liberating the vast number
of colored people of the South, and throwing them suddenly
upon their own resources, with their wants unprovided for and
with no training, when it had not been their habit to think or
provide for themselves. Consequently, the sad result was that
crime was prevalent throughout this whole Southern country.
It therefore became sensible men to undertake to provide a
remedy; and the remedy is, to educate and Christianize the
race; and I am glad—indeed, happy—to be able to say that you
have contributed your full share toward bringing about that
happy result, for which this community ought to be profoundly
grateful.</p>

<p>“Now, for a moment, let us contrast the present state of things
with the past, which is vivid in our recollection because of
its sadness. I qualified as Prosecuting Attorney for this
county at the April Term of the County Court 1870, and have
held that office (with the exception of one term of four years)
from that time to the present. It was no uncommon thing—indeed
it was a common thing—to prosecute from two to four cases of
felony at every term of the court, and I have prosecuted as
many as seven felonies at one term of our Circuit Court, and
the jail was full or crowded with those awaiting trial. But for
the last four or five years <a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a>crime has gradually diminished,
until now it is a rare occurrence that we have a prisoner in
jail awaiting trial or a felony to prosecute; and the jail is
nearly all the time without an inmate. The present state of
things is so different that it is a subject of remark. May He
who directeth all things spare you long in the good work in
which you have accomplished so much. Very respectfully and
truly your friend,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">T.&nbsp;K. Weisiger</span>.”
</p></div>

<p>This statement speaks loudly, not only as regards the particular
case mentioned, but as regards the system which we are pursuing to
elevate the colored people. Mr. Henry, during his studies in Howard
University, was aided by funds contributed in Great Britain for the
assistance of needy colored students, and it will be cheering to
those benefactors to hear of the good which is being accomplished
by this beneficiary. Will not other benefactors come to our help by
furnishing other endowments and scholarships?</p>

<h3>REVIVAL WORK AT FISK UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. H.&nbsp;S. BENNETT.</p>

<p>The religious history of Fisk University divides itself into two
portions, that before New Year and after. Before the New Year, the
week given to the Young Men’s Christian Association passed, and
the work of holding nightly prayer meetings was taken in hand by
the students. Several conversions resulted. After the new year had
set in and I had returned from my Northern trip, I felt that the
time had come for direct effort for the conversion of the students.
I, therefore, directed my preaching to that end and held nightly
meetings for inquirers. As a result two or three of the students
were converted. At length, being convinced that I could do little
more, I made no appointment for other meetings. At this point the
young men in Livingstone Hall came forward and offered to carry
on the meetings in their own way. I was glad to give them the
opportunity to go forward. This they did, visiting from room to
room and inviting the unconverted out. The result was that there
was a large increase in the interest. The inquiry meetings were
full, and from ten to fifteen were seeking Christ every night. This
work went on for several weeks and resulted in the conversion of
fifteen or more—twenty-two for the whole year. There is still some
interest, although other things have interfered to divert the minds
of the students from the direct effort for the salvation of souls.</p>

<h3>EMERSON INSTITUTE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS EMMA CAUGHEY, MOBILE, ALA.</p>

<p>The accompanying cut of Emerson Institute presents it in its
new and enlarged proportions. Oct 3d, 1882, with much joy and
thanksgiving, we dedicated its new walls, “Pro Christo et
Humanitate.” It is a fine substantial building, well adapted to
our school work. A basement play-room under the entire building
furnishes protection to the children on rainy days. The first floor
contains three pleasant school-rooms, four halls and a library.
Four stair-ways lead to the play-room, and the same number lead up
to the second floor, where are three more cheery, well ventilated
school-rooms, separated from each other by uplifting sash doors,
by which the entire upper story may be thrown into one large hall.
Here we assemble for morning devotions, hold our public rhetoricals
and evening socials. Contributions from friends at the North have
enabled us to place a reading table in one corner of the normal
room, furnished with the best weeklies and monthlies, a handsome
clock and some tasteful mottoes on the wall, each of which we may
hope is a little rill flowing into that stream of silent influences
which<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a>
serves not only to brighten the lives of the pupils but to help
them to a nobler manhood and a purer womanhood. We have enrolled
during the year three hundred and twenty-one different pupils
under the care of six teachers. We have an industrial department
connected with our school, in which sewing and fancy work are
taught. We meet for two hours each Friday evening at the close of
the regular session of school. This evening hour is a happy climax
to the week for the girls, but is a great tension upon the nervous
force of the teachers at the end of the week’s wear and tear. We
close this department of our school with a fair, where the articles
made by the girls are offered for sale, the proceeds of which are
to be divided between foreign missions and our own worthy poor.</p>

<h3>INDUSTRIAL WORK AT ATLANTA UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MR. H.&nbsp;M. SESSIONS.</p>

<p>Having been connected with this institution more than a year,
we have learned from the boys in school from all parts of the
South, as well as from our own observation in the State, of the
limited scope of the agricultural products in this section. Most
of the boys have been accustomed to farm work, and in answer to
the question, “What kind of crops have you been used to raising?”
they reply invariably, “corn and cotton.” It has been the custom
of the planters here to use their means, men, teams and credit to
raise cotton. While they are raising crops they run in debt for
provisions, and at the end of the year frequently fail to realize
enough from the crops to pay the bills. Some are learning the
better way of raising a variety of crops for the family, and a few
acres of cotton for a money crop. The great want of successful
farming is fertilizers. The land is so impoverished that there is
no use in trying to raise a crop without. With plenty of manure,
we can secure as good crops as can be raised anywhere. Our tables
were supplied last summer with a great variety of vegetables and
our barns filled with fodder. Twelve acres only out of the sixty
owned by the Institution have been under cultivation, our own table
with 240 boarders making a market. The advantages of climate enable
us to raise two or three crops a year on the same land. The soil
is capable of producing any and every variety of crops that can be
raised elsewhere in the United States.</p>

<p>Whatever possibilities may be attained in literary pursuits for
generations to come, most of the manual labor at the South will
be performed by the colored man. The great want at the present
time is skilled laborers. The abundant resources are awaiting men
as well as means for their development—men skilled in all the
useful trades, educated in both muscle and brain, such as can
plan as well as execute. There is a surplus of ignorant laborers
South who cannot set themselves to work at anything but the most
menial service. If the present generation can be instructed by
skilled labor how to get a good living and earn money to educate
their children, then the next generation can take a step higher.
The opportunities offered the boys here to learn the useful arts
will be enlarged. At the present time we are only developing the
agricultural department in a small way for want of means. We are
trying to utilize the labor of the boys for their advantage, as
well as profit to the Institution. With a fair supply of mulberry
trees, we propose to commence the culture of silk. This spring we
have twenty-five boys competing for the premiums offered for the
largest product of early garden vegetables grown on the square rod.
The work is to be done during play hours and the crop harvested
before the close of the term, the 15th of June. Monthly lectures
on important farm topics are given to the students. We need an

<h3>AFRICA AT ATLANTA.</h3>

<p>In a private letter Mrs. Chase writes about a young man from the
west coast of Africa as follows: I must tell you about Philip. We
had very interesting meetings last week. Thursday the topic was for
the church. Philip who had not had courage to speak in meetings
before this year, got up and said he was ashamed of having been so
afraid of being laughed at by the boys; he expected in a few years
to teach about Jesus in his own country—and it is your country,
too. He then went on with his intense earnestness and broken
English to tell of his home—how dear it was to him and how dear
his people were—how sad it was that they did not know about Jesus,
till I do not think there was a dry eye in the room. The meeting
the next night was a larger one, as we have no study hours Friday
night. We saw the effect of Philip’s thrilling words. More than
one referred to them. A young woman who decided to be a missionary
to Africa last year, said every word Philip spoke seemed meant for
her. “To think that boy, who was a heathen such a little while ago,
could justly say such things to us with our privileges, made me
feel condemned. I want to preach the gospel to the heathen. I pray
that I may be fitted for the blessed work. I don’t want money, I
don’t want fame, but I do want such a spirit that it shall be my
meat and drink to do my Father’s will.” Philip’s Bible, which he
brought with him, is very fine print, and has no references. He
wanted a new one, so as he had earned some money in summer, one of
the teachers purchased him one. He is so pleased with it he takes
it to bed with him. One day he asked his teacher if he could not
buy some silk to cover it with. When she suggested covering it with
paper, he did not like it at all. I am so glad he is with us, he is
a great power.</p>

<h3>ONE DAY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS ADELE BREWER, RALEIGH, N.C.</p>

<p>Would you like to spend Sunday with us among the colored people
at the South? The bell for Sunday School sounded at nine o’clock.
At three, we answered the call for church. We saluted the sexton,
a pretty girl, who was ringing the bell as we entered. The neat
little church still had its Christmas trimmings. We were delighted
with everything, the earnest minister, the good organ, the
well-trained choir. Every word of the responsive reading was so
clearly enunciated that it was a pleasure to listen. The pastor’s
wife came in with her manly son and her wee baby. That smallest
auditor behaved well. The missionary was there with the orphan she
is training. Notices for the week were given out—Lyceum, Church
prayer meeting, and the Women’s prayer meeting.</p>

<p>After the benediction, before we had hardly thought of turning in
our places, we felt the pressure of a baby’s hand. Little Clara,
aged five, had hastened to us. She had come to church alone. It was
sweet to look at her and know what an angel of light she is. Her
mother, though an invalid, takes in washing. She hires some one
to carry the clothes. Clara wishes to grow. “Why?” “So I can tote
de clothes.” In former days, long before she came to earth, her
parents were prosperous. They bought land and built two houses, one
for themselves and one to rent. Her father, still in the prime of
life, is paralyzed and blind. Day after day he sits by the fire,
unable to read, or work, or move. We have seen his blind, twitching
face light tenderly at the touch of his only child. Clara led us
along slowly, and we chatted with the missionary and her friends.
One young lady has bought land, built a house for herself and
furnished it well with carpet and organ. She is helping her sisters
in their education. We met many whose friends were at school. We
shook hands with the good deacons.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></p>

<p>Some young girls were waiting at home for us. They wished to talk
about “going North.” As soon as they had left, a friend sent by
us an orange to Mrs. Knowles. In her one dark room, over a smoky
fireplace, she was sitting, paralyzed, rheumatic and very “painy,”
without kith or kin to help her, dependent on neighbors for food,
wood and water; her lot did not seem an enviable one. “The children
are mighty kind to me.” Boys come in and cut a stick of wood at a
time. She cooks meal, her chief article of food, in three different
ways, “<a id="Err_1" name="Err_1"></a>so as to have a little variety, you know.” Often suffers for
“suthing t’eat;” seldom knows whence the next dinner will come.</p>

<p>As we left the room we heard crying. Leaning by the fence, alone
and screaming, was a little girl. “What is it?” “A boy threw a rock
and hit me here,” showing her side. “Where is your home?” “Right
over yonder.” “Shall I take you there?” “No; mother is not there.”
It proved that her sister and friend were frolicking and helping
(?) Mrs. Knowles. Her sister answered the appeal for help. “Hush,
Queen; quit making such a fuss.” The friend explained: “She never
did like to be hit by a rock, nohow.” We noticed the feet of the
friend. A piece of leather tied around them, showing the bare toes.
Many children can not go to Sunday-school because they have no
shoes.</p>

<p>After tea we went to the S.&nbsp;S. Concert. In giving out the subject,
the teacher said she did not want to call it a Lying Concert,
though the verses were about lying, so she called it a Truth
Concert. The room was full. Little Clara’s mother could not go,
so the wee maiden invited a young lady to be her escort. The
concert was excellent. The texts were well recited and the pastor’s
remarks summed up the matter. At the close an appeal was made in
behalf of a poor and sick scholar. A member of her class carried
around the basket, and a dollar and seventy-nine cents was given
in response. This little church takes up three collections a day,
yet its members are very poor and the winter has been hard on all.
One family stayed in bed till late in the afternoon to save wood
to cook supper. A young man, sick with consumption, had nothing
provided for him but bacon and cornmeal, which his delicate
appetite loathed. It is hard to earn much, receiving thirty cents
a week for a washing. We asked a widow if she was comfortable when
her husband was alive. “Oh yes; I had plenty to eat, plenty to
eat. He was cross sometimes, as men are, but I always had plenty
to eat.” We lay down to rest that night with new feelings of
gratitude and shame. “What shall we render unto the Lord for all
His benefits?”</p>

<h3>COLOR LINE IN FLORIDA.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. ALBERT P. MILLER.</p>

<p>While the “color-line” is being freely discussed in the leading
Christian journals of the day, as to so-called “mixed churches,”
the following incident may show to the Christian world the
attitude taken by the African Methodist Episcopal Church—400,000
strong—with whose work I was very pleasantly connected last
year. One of our preachers, a Rev. C.&nbsp;J. Croom, having charge
of the Hamburg circuit in the East Florida Conference, was last
year holding a series of revival meetings. The spirit waxed hot,
and large numbers came rolling in from every quarter night after
night. Conversions began to crown the efforts of the pastor, among
the colored members of the congregation. As is very often the
case several white friends were in attendance. One night after a
soul-stirring sermon the preacher called on all who wanted to be
prayed for to come and bow at the front seats. A great many came,
and among these a white woman, who that night was deeply convicted.
Her mother, brother and sister were terribly enraged, that she
should be out so late at a “nigger meeting,” and came down on her
very heavily. The next night, however, found her, more anxious
than ever, at the “nigger revival.” The mother, who would not go
herself, sent her son and daughter to bring their sister home. On
arriving they became so much interested in what was going on that
they decided to remain. They began to feel “funny.” Still they sat
and looked on and saw their sister again press forward for prayer.
They still felt “funny,” but<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a> couldn’t go. By and by the sister,
who sat in the audience, went to get her anxious sister, and take
her home. No sooner had she put her hands on her than she herself
fell under conviction, and both that night were happily converted
to God. Their brother at once became deeply concerned, and was
soon rejoicing with his sisters and the Negroes in the “liberty
wherewith Christ doth make his children free.”</p>

<p>“Big Sunday” came, day for communion and reception of members.
Candidates received on profession were to be baptized, either by
sprinkling or immersion. Our white brother and his two dear sisters
having been received into full membership chose to go down under
the water, which they did with several others, being baptized by
Bro. Croom. Some of the white neighbors were a little offended at
the conduct of both the colored preacher and his white brother
and sisters in the Lord, and asked him to leave. But he told them
frankly that he didn’t convert the candidates, and that if the same
God who had changed their hearts, led them also to seek admission
into his church, there was nothing, either in his Bible or his
discipline, that would prohibit their becoming regular members of
his church. Bro. Croom tells me that these three converts are among
the most faithful of his members, and that he “would be glad to
receive many more such members into the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, for God is no respecter of persons,” and why should we be?</p>

<h3>WOMAN’S MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS M.&nbsp;K. LUNT, SELMA.</p>

<p>The Alabama Branch of the Woman’s Missionary Association held its
annual meeting in the Normal room of Talladega College, March
27. The attendance was good, and the reports from the local
societies very encouraging. The officers, with but two exceptions,
were re-elected to serve for the coming year. After devotional
exercises, Mrs. De Forest gave an address of welcome, in which
she reminded us of the important work God had put in our hands to
carry on, and that <em>our</em> part is to be <em>doers</em>, leaving results
to Him. The local societies have given considerable time to
industrial work, disposing of clothing, quilts, and fancy articles,
aggregating the sum of $175, disbursing for Foreign Missions and
home interests $116.85, leaving a balance for further distribution.
Mothers’ meetings, children’s meetings, and sewing classes have
received their share of attention. At the public meeting in March,
in Selma, Mrs. McDougal, correspondent of the New York <cite>Weekly
Witness</cite>, was present, and all enjoyed her fresh, practical and
inspiring words.</p>

<p>Several papers were listened to with interest, the first read by
Miss Jillson, on “Our Duty to Foreign Missions and the means by
which an interest may be Promoted.” Miss Plimpton and Mrs. A.&nbsp;W.
Curtis followed in discussion on the subject. Mrs. Curtis spoke
of the joy her husband’s mother felt in giving three sons to the
missionary fields; how this love had been awakened in her children
by reading to them from the <cite>Missionary Herald</cite>. Mrs. Andrews read
letters of greeting from the President and Secretary of the Boston
Association. Miss Chafin sent a paper, on “Do we owe a Tenth to the
Lord?”</p>

<p>A poem was read by Miss Partridge, “So Much to do at Home.” In
this an African Chief is begging for some Christian teachers to go
with him to lead his people to the Saviour, but is denied because
there is so much at home to be done. Mrs. Fay gave a talk on “How
to organize Missionary Societies,” urging the members of those
churches who have no such organization to form one at once.</p>

<p>Miss Mickle presented another paper on “Hath She Done what She
Could?” Mrs. Steele of Chattanooga, Tenn., was present and offered
the closing prayer. Singing was interspersed, and we felt that the
hours had brought to us an encouragement and strength which will
make us more hopeful for the future.</p>

<h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>THE NEW MISSION IN SOUTH CHINA.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND.</p>

<p>The memorable event of the month of February—so far as our work is
concerned—is the inauguration of the mission of the American Board
to Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong to those districts of South
China from which most of our Chinese have come. Rev. C.&nbsp;R. Hager, a
recent graduate of our Pacific Theological Seminary, and for more
than a year past a very successful and greatly beloved pastor at
Antioch, in this State, having offered himself to the Board as a
Foreign Missionary, was at our own suggestion and request appointed
to take charge of this new work, and was ordained as a Missionary
at Bethany Church, on Friday, Feb. 16. One of the exercises at
the ordination service was an address by Jee Gam, a portion of
which, I trust, can be crowded into the space allotted in the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span> to our work. It will scarcely be necessary
for me to add anything, unless it be to say that to my faith
this work thus begun looms up in grand proportions, as fraught
with most beneficent results. I am prepared in spirit patiently
to wait—prepared, if such be God’s will, utterly to fail—but
my faith feels so strong, my hopes are so high, so bright, so
confident, that I seem to myself already to be entering on the
harvest, and the joy of harvest fills my heart.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>JEE GAM’S ADDRESS.</h4>

<p>It was ten years ago when our Chinese brethren first felt the
need of a mission in China at or near the districts from which
most of our brethren came. They grew more and more anxious for
this mission, when they heard of the aid and refuge given to the
persecuted Christians by the other mission in Canton city.</p>

<p>The first three years we often expressed our great desire among
ourselves for this mission, but never thought of telling our
superintendent, Rev. W.&nbsp;C. Pond. Not a word was said to him
until at our usual Wednesday afternoon Bible class, about seven
years ago, when the subject of foreign missions was accidentally
mentioned. We then told Rev. W.&nbsp;C. Pond what we so much desired.
He at once approved of it. Hong Kong was chosen for the seat of
this mission, and Mr. Pond requested that those who were able to
write a letter should do so, explaining why this mission was so
much needed. He accordingly forwarded these letters to the American
Missionary Association. Though the Association sympathized with
us in our want, yet how this mission could be established looked
very doubtful. The matter was left to stand; but we remembered
that James tells us to ask in faith, nothing wavering, and we knew
that God was able to supply all our needs; so we kept on praying.
In the first part of October, 1879, I was greatly surprised by the
very generous invitation which the American Missionary Association
tendered me to attend its annual meeting at Chicago. I started for
the East, but thought nothing of this Hong Kong mission until at
the annual meeting, when I felt moved by the Holy Spirit to make
an earnest plea for it. I also spoke for it at all the meetings I
attended while East.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 4th of August, 1882 (the same day the Chinese
Restriction bill went into effect), the good news came through our
superintendent that the American Board had consented to establish
the Hong Kong Mission. Oh, how my heart, filled to overflowing,
went out to God in thanksgiving and praise! Immediately we called
the brethren to tell them the good news. Christ has told us to
ask and we shall receive; yet, when this ten years’ prayer was
answered, it<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a> seemed almost too much to believe, and we are here
this evening to praise God once more for his love to us and our
benighted countrymen in China. * * *</p>

<p>Having Hong Kong for headquarters, missionaries and teachers can
be sent from there to preach and teach in the villages from which
our young men come. Besides this, the English language is used
more in Hong Kong than in <a id="Err_2" name="Err_2"></a>any other part of China, and the Chinese
living there, or those visiting that place, could not be reached
in a more efficient manner than by opening the same kind of free
schools for them that you have opened for us here. They need to
know the English language. Of course there are public schools,
where both the English and Chinese languages are taught by the
British Government, but all have their sessions in the daytime:
consequently, the children are the only ones benefited by these
schools. There remains the laboring class unreached. If a free
evening school is opened, I have no doubt that much good could
be done among them. Moreover, Hong Kong is a great highway to
all foreign ports, especially San Francisco. Through Hong Kong
nearly all the Chinese in the United States have come and will
return. If a general mission could be established at this port,
much co-operating work could be accomplished between our missions
here and that at Hong Kong. Christian Chinese returning home would
receive letters of introduction to the superintendent of the Hong
Kong mission. This superintendent would have pastoral care over
them, and would be a very great help in time of persecution.
Converts would be made <a id="Err_3" name="Err_3"></a>firmer in faith, and more earnest in leading
others to Christ.</p>

<p>The Congregational Association of Christian Chinese, at its last
annual meeting, voted to give $500 toward the establishing of this
Hong Kong mission, and do all in its power to help in the future.
God be praised, for he has shown his wonderful love to China. He
is to be praised for this beloved brother, who so kindly offers
himself for the Master’s service. He is to be praised for the
American Board which sends him. May the Lord raise up many more
like workers, who shall devote their lives to China.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let me add that besides this gift of money, our mission sends with
Mr. Hager one of our very best helpers, Lee Sam. We shall miss him
greatly, but we have plead for this new work, expecting that it
would draw upon us in that way largely. To raise up and train men
for Gospel work among the millions beyond the sea, will now be one
of the chief ends to be kept in view in our work in California. And
because of this, we ask with an intensity of desire scarcely known
to us before, a place in the prayers of God’s people throughout our
whole land.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN’S PAGE.</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF THE ORGAN.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MRS. WALTER E.&nbsp;C. WRIGHT, BEREA, KY.</p>

<p>“Pine Grove College,” as it is called in Jackson County, needed
an organ; there was no doubt about that. But the likelihood of
obtaining it seemed small. Away up there in the mountains of
Kentucky, there were few who had ever seen an organ, and only
the teacher knew how much it would help in the day school, the
Sunday-school and the preaching services. So Miss Barton sang
herself hoarse trying to teach the children to sing by rote, and on
Sunday the minister had to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a> line the hymns for want of books. (Your
grandmamma can tell you what I mean by “<em>lining</em> the hymn.”) In all
the mountain churches, both colored and white, the people always
sing in that way, and having no organ to keep them together, they
come out at the end one behind the other, like the “rounds” you
sing at school.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/family.jpg" width="500" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="center">MOUNTAIN FAMILY SINGING PSALMS.</div>
</div>

<p>One day a teacher from Berea went up to visit the school, and when
she saw the bright, eager faces of the children, and the effort
the teacher was making to have them learn to sing, she said, “Why,
how much you need an organ here. It would lift these children
into a whole new world of ideas.” “Yes, I know it,” answered Miss
Barton, “but where is it to come from?” Well, Miss D. went home and
thought it over, and then wrote to Miss Barton that if the people
there would raise thirty dollars, she would see that they had an
organ. Miss Barton did not feel much encouraged, for the people in
that region are not rich, and one dollar looks very large to them.
However, she read Miss D.’s letter to them at Sabbath school, and
explained what an advantage it would be to have the instrument to
use. To her great surprise they pledged the amount at once, though
many of them cannot afford sugar in their coffee, or butter on the
corn bread, which, with bacon, is the staple of their living. I
have not time to tell how Miss D. raised the rest of the money,
how she found a dealer who had a very fine organ to sell at second
hand,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a> and who threw off fifteen dollars when he found for what she
wanted it—nor how one friend in Tallmadge and another in Akron
helped on, and at last the organ was ordered and sent. It was
expected on a certain Saturday, and on Sunday morning you might
have seen the people gathering in unusually large numbers. All who
did not walk came on horseback. There a mother with her baby on
her arm, and a little girl behind her on the family horse. Here
the father, with a three-year-old boy behind him on the colt, and
yonder three older children on another horse, all sitting with that
easy security they express when they say “I was born on a horse,”
and thinking no more about it than you do when you ride in a street
car.</p>

<p>But when the people reached the school-house their faces fell as
they came in one after another and saw there was no organ on the
platform. The wagon had broken down bringing it over the almost
impassable roads from the station twenty miles away, and at last
Sunday-school was commenced with a feeling of disappointment in all
hearts. Even brave Miss Barton felt a lump in her throat, for she
had counted on it like the meeting of an old friend in a strange
land. But just in the middle of the lesson the creaking of wheels
was heard and some men came in with <em>something</em> still encased in
the box in which it was packed. No more lesson that day. Every boy
and girl, colored and white, was as eager and curious as if this
was a stray cage from some menagerie. Finally, with some little
trouble, the packing-case was removed, and there was a plain,
quiet little walnut thing, looking some like a small cupboard, and
now the question arose on which side was it made to stand? The
teacher, seeing the dilemma, suggested the proper base, on which it
was firmly placed. Then a chair was brought, some books piled on
it—and <em>then</em> they found there was no key. But somebody produced
a nail, the cover was lifted, and there was their organ smiling
at them and showing every one of its pretty white teeth. And oh,
when the wonderful thing began to sing, how pleased they were! The
children forgot that they too could sing</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,”</span><br />
</p>

<p>while listening to the beautiful, strange voice. Presently they
gained courage and joined in the Gospel hymns (which the common
people <em>do</em> sing gladly), and sang, and sang, and sang, all through
the time for Sabbath school and all through the time for preaching.</p>

<p>I think the angels hearing the sounds must have rejoiced that day
with great hope for the souls that might be won to repentance
through the Coming of the Organ.</p>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted
its main efforts to preparing the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their
duties as citizens and Christians in America, and as missionaries
in Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the
caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate
with the Government in its humane and Christian policy toward the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>.</p>

<h2>PROPOSED CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This society shall be called the American
Missionary Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to
conduct Christian missionary and educational operations and diffuse
a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other countries
which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Members may be constituted for life by the
payment of thirty dollars into the treasury of the Association,
with the written declaration at the time or times of payment that
the sum is to be applied to constitute a designated person a life
member; and such membership shall begin sixty days after the
payment shall have been completed.</p>

<p>Every church which has within a year contributed to the funds of
the Association and every State Conference or Association of such
churches may appoint two delegates to the Annual Meeting of the
Association; such delegates, duly attested by credentials, shall be
members of the Association for the year for which they were thus
appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be
held in the month of October or November, at such time and place as
may be designated by the Executive Committee, by notice printed in
the official publication of the Association for the preceding month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The officers of the Association shall be a
President, five Vice-Presidents, a Corresponding Secretary or
Secretaries, a Recording Secretary, a Treasurer, Auditors, and
an Executive Committee of fifteen members, all of whom shall be
elected by ballot.</p>

<p>At the first Annual Meeting after the adoption of this
Constitution, five members of the Executive Committee shall be
elected for the term of one year, five for two years and five for
three years, and at each subsequent Annual Meeting, five members
shall be elected for the full term of three years, and such others
as shall be required to fill vacancies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the
collecting and disbursing of funds, the appointing, counseling,
sustaining and dismissing of missionaries and agents, and the
selection of missionary fields. They shall have authority to fill
all vacancies in office occurring between the Annual Meetings;
to apply to any Legislature for acts of incorporation, or
conferring corporate power; to make provision when necessary for
disabled missionaries and for the widows and children of deceased
missionaries, and in general to transact all such business as
usually appertains to the Executive Committees of missionary and
other benevolent societies. The acts of the Committee shall be
subject to the revision of the Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee constitute a quorum for transacting
business.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> No person shall be made an officer of this
Association who is not a member of some evangelical church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> Missionary bodies and churches or individuals
may appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, through the
agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution
except by the vote of two-thirds of the members present at an
Annual Meeting, the amendment having been approved by the vote of a
majority at the previous Annual Meeting.</p>

invented and patented by <b>MR. INGERSOLL</b>. For <b>writing
letters</b>, <b>addressing envelopes</b>, <b>lettering
show cards</b>, <b>tickets</b>, <b>printing labels</b> and
<b>circulars</b>, it has no equal. It will last a lifetime and is
the most useful and fascinating machine ever invented. Children
learn their letters, the arrangement of letters into words,
and words into sentences by its use. As you will see by the
illustration this is no <b>cheap fraud</b> with metal type, but is
a well made machine with patent rubber-faced type. It is impossible
to lose the letters or soil your fingers. The ink fountains will
last for months, and can be replenished in one moment with ink
furnished for the purpose. Great taste may be displayed in using
the two colors of ink, as all letters can be inked from either
pad. A letter can be written as perfectly as with a <b>$50 Type
